    <div note="Entry #1 6/5/2023: Pale Blue Dot">
      <h2>Our Pale Blue Dot</h2>
      <img
        src="images/PaleBlueDot.jpg"
        width="283"
        height="384"
        style="float: left; margin-right: 10"
        alt="Picture of Earth, as seen from deep outer space, a single pixel in the vast cosmos"
      />
      "Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived
      out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
      coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every
      teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust
      suspended in a sunbeam.<br /><br />

      The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could
      become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable
      inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.<br /><br />

      Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a
      lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<br /><br />

      The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet.
      Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<br /><br />

      It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant
      image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
      ever known."

      <h2>Feynman's Love Letter to His Dead Wife</h2>
      October 17, 1946<br /><br />

      D’Arline,<br /><br />

      I adore you, sweetheart.<br /><br />

      I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.<br /><br />

      It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I
      thought there was no sense to writing.<br /><br />

      But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love
      you. I always will love you.<br /><br />

      I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care
      for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started
      to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and
      general instigator of all our wild adventures.<br /><br />

      When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no
      real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving
      anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.<br /><br />

      I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a
      girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I
      don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.<br /><br />

      My darling wife, I do adore you.<br /><br />

      I love my wife. My wife is dead.<br /><br />

      Rich.<br /><br />

      PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.<br />

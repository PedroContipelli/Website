    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">My Own Thoughts</h1>
    <h5 style="margin-top: 3;">Every once in a while, I'll have some thoughts of my own that I like to write down. Here's the place for those reflections longer than a tweet.</h5>

    <div note="The Meaning of Life">
      <h2>Nihilism Deconstructed</h2>
      What is the meaning of life? I have a few problems with this question. Beginning with the word "the".
      Why is the implicit assumption that there <i>must</i> be exactly one anyways? Rather than two or three or more,
      if any at all. Secondly, what is it actually asking? If I were to ask what is the meaning of "Apple", someone might
      respond with the definition of the word. But the general consensus here is that we're not looking for a definition
      of the word "life", no. So it may be important to ask what exactly <i>are</i> we looking for then?
      <br><br>
      In the endless yet futile human struggle to make sense of this reality, we can barely think to ask about why it is that we fall asleep,
      remain unconscious for 8 hours at a time, and wake up to continue about the next day as if this is absolutely normal and
      not at all concerning. For most people... and most questions for that matter, life is not a thing to be questioned but rather accepted.
      Socialized. Yet this is the question that does not seem to go away. It sits there gnawing at us in the back of our minds as we continue
      our daily cycle. Plaguing the minds of philosophers for millennia. What is the meaning of music? What is the meaning of love? We don't care.
      We want to know... what is the meaning of <b>life</b>? Some deeper truth we hope to encounter one day that will finally make it all make sense.
      Our lives we spent building up to complete a giant jigsaw puzzle, and now the final piece is missing. We'll die before we ever figure
      out the answer. A purpose to it all. The question we're really trying to answer is: what is the <b>purpose</b> of life?
      <br><br>
      And to that I say, well, what is the purpose of a cog in a machine?... if not to serve the ends of that machine. Which then begs the question...
      well what is the purpose of the machine? And we could go on forever asking about a higher and higher purpose to no end. This, for me at least,
      highlights an important realization that for <i>anything</i> to have a meaning implies the existence of a greater purpose to serve. But there <i>is</i>
      no greater purpose to those things which are ends in and of themselves. Like love or music. They can bring us the greatest of joys, yet also
      to the darkest depths of sadness. No one needs to ask: what is the meaning of love? Love needs no justification beyond its own existence. It is
      something to felt. Experienced.
      <br></br>
      Why then should the meaning of life be treated any different from the meaning of love? Life is meaningless in that it is no means to an end,
      but an end itself. Rather than serve some purpose, it <i>is</i> the purpose. A delight and a challenge which forever refuses to provide justification
      for its own existence. And I'm here to convince you that we should be thankful for this, if not over the moon ecstatic about it.
      <br></br>
      I for one could not think of a more boring reality than a life with a predetermined purpose. Imagine if from the day you were born, you were destined
      to be a farmer your whole life. Your meaning, your purpose simply to grow and harvest your crops year after year, with not an ounce of input from you
      into its direction. Where would be the fun in that? Where is the excitement?! What makes your life interesting? Worthwile? We are more than lucky; we are
      blessed that this is not the case. No, in this life we have the freedom to choose what <i>we</i> want to do with it. There is no greater gift than that.
      <br></br>
      To me, the only thing that makes life worth living <i>is</i> its nature as a sandbox. A vacuum of space. A giant blank canvas for something to be created.
      From the moment we are born, our story is left to be written and we are the ones who get to write it. You chose to become a farmer because you wanted to
      do something good for the world and provide food for people. Your passion was to plant and grow and harvest. No one forced it upon you.
      We sit here and realize in all of our preoccupation with trying to find and chase some higher purpose, that we forgot to look down here on Earth and
      missed the ball.
